# Option Pricing
This is the Assignment on Option Pricing for my Quantitative Finance Course. I chose a stock from the `NIFTY 50` Index and calculated the option price for it using the following strategies:
- Geometric Brownian Motion-based Stock Price Modelling.
- Black-Scholes Model.
- Recombining Binomial Tree Model.
- Monte-Carlo Techniques for Black-Scholes Price Modelling.
- Convergence of Recombining Binomial Tree Model to Black-Scholes Model.
- Implied Volatility Calculation.
